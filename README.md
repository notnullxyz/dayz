Random tools to facilitate a lubcricated modification of some of the DayZ server files.

## Disclaimer ##
Bugs may affect the output, as could the DayZ server version, or random events of chance. If you're going to use it, then make backups of your originals and don't trust random scripts on the internet.

## Usage ##
- Download the script.
- Open it in your browser, or put it somewhere publically accessible.
- Upload your original, backed up, configuration/XML file.
- Change stuff.
- Download the modified version
- Put it on your DayZ server in the right/original location.
- Restart your DayZ server.
- Go away.

## Outro
Thanks for trying it out. They work, pretty OK as of August 2024, for me. If they don't work for you, something changed on DayZ, or you are using an older version or something.
